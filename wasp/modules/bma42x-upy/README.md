# BMA42x Sensor API for MicroPython

## Quickstart

In the directory containing your [MicroPython external C
modules](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/cmodules.html) try:

~~~ sh
git clone https://github.com/daniel-thompson/bma42x-upy
cd bma42x-upy
git submodule update --init
~~~

After updating the submodules see `BMA423-Sensor-API/README.md` for more
information about the driver.

## Credits

Thanks to Aaron Christophel ([ATCnetz](https://ATCnetz.de)) for doing
the initial reverse engineering. bma42x-upy doesn't contain any code
from Aaron but his work was hugely important in helping us understand
how the hardware works.
