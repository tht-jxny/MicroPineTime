Roadmap
=======

M1: Dumb watch feature parity
-----------------------------

The focus for M1 is to get wasp-os both to meet feature parity with a dumb
watch and to have a bootloader and watchdog strategy that is robust enough
to allow a PineTime case to be confidently glued shut.

Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* [X] Basic board ports (PineTime, DS-D6, 96Boards Nitrogen)
* [X] OTA application update
* [X] Enable watchdog before starting the application
* [X] Splash screen
* [X] Ignore start button for first few seconds

MicroPython
~~~~~~~~~~~

* [X] Basic board ports (PineTime, DS-D6, 96Boards Nitrogen)
* [X] Long press reset (conditional feeding of the watchdog)

  * [X] Feed dog from REPL polling loop
  * [X] Feed dog from a tick interrupt

Wasp-os
~~~~~~~

* [X] Display driver

  * [X] Display initialization
  * [X] Bitmap blitting
  * [X] RLE coder and decoder
  * [X] Optimized RLE inner loops

* [X] Backlight driver
* [X] Button driver (polling)
* [X] Battery/charger driver
* [X] Simple clock and battery level application
* [X] Basic (WFI) power saving
* [X] Implement simple RTC for nrf52

M2: Great developer experience
------------------------------

The focus for M2 is to make development faster and easier by providing
a file system and file transfer code. This allows much faster
development cycles compared to full downloads of frozen modules.
Additionally support for multiple event-driven applications will be
added during M2 to further help developers by providing example
applications.

Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* [X] OTA bootloader update
* [X] RTC time measurement whilst in bootloader

MicroPython
~~~~~~~~~~~

* [X] SPI FLASH driver
* [X] Enable LittleFS on SPI FLASH (at boot)
* [X] BLE file transfer

Wasp-os
~~~~~~~

* [X] Add dd/mm/yyyy support to RTC
* [X] Button driver (interrupt based)
* [X] Touch sensor driver
* [X] Event driven application framework
* [X] Stopwatch app
* [X] Settings app
* [X] PC-hosted simulation platform
* [X] Documentation

  * [X] Sphinx framework and integration with github.io
  * [X] Document bootloader protocols
  * [X] Application writer's guide
  * [X] Write full docstring documentation for all wasp-os components

* [X] Application Launcher
* [X] Debug notifications
* [X] Multi-colour RLE images

  * [X] Optimized "2-bit" RLE encoder and decoder
  * [X] Logarithmic RBG332 <-> RGB56516bit color space conversion

M3: Smartwatch
--------------

At M3 we start to build out full fitness tracking and notification
functionality.

~~~~~~~~~~

* [ ] Stay in bootloader after battery run down
* [ ] Implement power off support (no splash screen)

Reloader
~~~~~~~~

* [ ] Board identity check
* [ ] Pre-flash image verification
* [ ] Post-flash image verification
* [ ] Error checking

Micropython
~~~~~~~~~~~

* [ ] Use SoftDevice sleep logic
* [ ] Automatically enter SPI flash power saving mode

Wasp-os
~~~~~~~

* [ ] Enable heart rate sensor

  * [ ] HRS3300 driver
  * [ ] HRS data post-processing
  * [ ] Heart rate counter app

* [ ] Notifications

  * [ ] BLE notification protocol
  * [ ] Notification popups
  * [ ] Notification app (show notification history)
  * [ ] Find a recommended Android app

* [ ] Step counting

  * [ ] BMA421 driver
  * [ ] Step counter app

* [ ] Documentation

  * [ ] Debugging and troubleshooting guide
  * [ ] Screenshots for bootloader and all applications
  * [ ] Improve the install guide
